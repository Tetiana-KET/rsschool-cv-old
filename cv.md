## About Me

I have been in the trade for 20 years, so I am organized, sociable, able to control myself and smooth out conflict situations. I am diligent, punctual and perhaps even pedantic. I love order in every little thing. After so many years, I wanted novelty, new knowledge, new experiences. I was charmed with the magic of coding. Watching the letters of the code turn into something visible, beautiful and understandable is exciting.

## English

I graduated from the Chernivtsi National University the department of Foreign Languages ​​in 2004. Since then, I have never worked in my specialty and have hardly used English in my life. So I forgot a lot, but now I try to read something in English every day and study using Duolingo.
