    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have been in the trade for 20 years, so I am organized, sociable, able to control myself and smooth out conflict situations. 
    I am diligent, punctual and perhaps even pedantic. I love order in every little thing. 
    After so many years, I wanted novelty, new knowledge, new experiences. I was charmed with the magic of coding. 
    Watching the letters of the code turn into something visible, beautiful and understandable is exciting.</p>
